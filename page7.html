                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-2"><strong><em>Miss Numè of Japan</em> by Onoto Watanna</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">One of the major themes that Onoto Watanna (Winnifred Eaton) handled in her literary works was cultural heritage. Watanna came from a British-Chinese family and pulled on this aspect within her writing. For this assignment, I chose to read her first published novel Miss Numè of Japan. This book investigates the lives of four main characters as they grapple with following their hearts or letting the pressure of Japanese marital traditions influence their decisions. 
<br>Riddled throughout this book are insights into Japanese culture. While the main theme associates to Japanese culture and how it relates to marriage, Watanna also delves into how Japanese cultures deals with honor or dishonor and gender roles. Two of the main characters and an extremely important secondary character are originally from the United States, therefore, this book also offers an outsider’s perspective into Japanese culture.<br> 
<br>The book opens with the introduction of two of the main characters, Orito Takashima and Numè Watanabe. Since Orito and Numè were ten and three years old, respectively, their fathers planned for them to be married. When Orito turns 18, his father sends him to the US to go to college while he waits for Numè to turn 18. While Orito is gone, Numè’s father allows her to intermingle with the American Elite community that lives in Tokyo because he wants to make sure that Orito will still like Numè after being exposed to American culture. This portion of the plot highlights the gender roles that flow throughout the book. Numè is never given a chose to make decisions about her life.<br>
<br>Toward the end of the book, we also see these gender roles highlighted. Orito falls in love with American whose name is Cleo as he’s traveling back from America. Before they reach Tokyo, he asks her to marry him and decides to tell his father that he will not marry Numè. When Orito tells his father and Numè’s father that he’s not going to marry Numè, they are both devastated and say that this decision will bring dishonor on to their family. As readers, we see the regret from Numè’s father as he grapples with the fact that she wasn’t born a son, and he even remarks that since she was a baby, he had only seen her as the future wife of Orito. Unfortunately, this shows how little regard women got during this time.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Numè meets an American man—who, coincidentally, is engaged to Cleo—named Arthur Sinclair. They first meet at a ball and spend the whole evening talking and getting to know each other. After the party, Mrs. Davis—a member of the American Elite community who lives in Tokyo—tells Numè that she can’t be spending whole evenings talking with a man who are engaged to another woman. Numè feels very guilty and tells Mr. Sinclair that she doesn’t like him and can’t speak with him anymore. However, Numè runs into Mr. Sinclair on her way to Tokyo, and they make plans to meet regularly in the woods. This is where their love really blossoms, and by the end of the book, they get married and move to the US.<br>  
<br>Watanna gives insights into an American perspective of Japanese culture through the character Mrs. Davis. To her and some of the other American characters, Japanese culture is routed in tradition and requires some explanation into why certain things work the way that they do. For instance, Mrs. Davis has lived in Japan for eight years. As she is talking with Cleo, she must explain why Cleo and Orito’s possible relationship will ruin the families of Orito and Numè. Cleo has a hard time understanding this because relationships and marriage function differently in the America, but in the end, Cleo tells Orito that she never intended to marry him and that she was just bored with being on the ship over to Tokyo.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">As discussed in the introduction, this book handles many themes. Specifically, this book gives readers insights into the Japanese culture, how Japanese traditions handle gender roles, and how it deals with the idea of bringing honor or dishonor to a Japanese household. Below are some (not all) quotes that reflect these themes.<br><br><strong>***Trigger Warning (TW):&nbsp;Mention of suicide in a quote explanation***</strong></p>

                <h6 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">“Thus it happened that Omi had perhaps more love for Orito as his father had, and even more love for Orito than he did for Numè, who was only a girl” (Watanna p. 66).</h6>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-6">
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Here readers first see a comparison between Omi’s love for Orito and for his own daughter, Numè. This is a glimpse into the gender roles that were at play in Japanese culture during this time. For instance, Omi holds resentment for Numè because she was born a girl rather than a boy. This is also why Omi holds so much excitement for the arranged marriage between Numè and Orito. He later remarks that he only ever saw Numè as Orito’s future wife rather than seeing her as anything else.</p>

                <h6 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">There are few things at work within this quote. First, we see the first instance where Omi and Mrs. Davis meet. Her Americanized perspective offers an outsider’s view of the way Omi is treating his daughter. Readers also see the play of gender roles a little bit. However, this quote shows how Mrs. Davis pushes these traditional gender roles. Where Omi wants his daughter to be quiet and secluded, Mrs. Davis is outspoken and confident. Rather than asking Omi to take his daughter out of the house for the day, she simply does it. Later she remarks that in no time she’ll have Omi letting Numè go wherever she wants without having to ask permission.</h6>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5">“[Mrs. Davis] would walk into Omi’s house in the most insinuating manner in the world, captivate the old man with her wit and grace, and carry off Numè right under his nose, even though he had told her of his resolve to keep his daughter in seclusion until marriage” (67).</p>

                <h6 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">“Numè belonged to the Kazoku order of Japanese (the nobles), the most exclusive class in Japan. They lived, as a rule, in the Province of Kyshu and their women were supposed to extremely beautiful, and kept in great seclusion, as the daughters of nobles usually are. Numè’s father, however, had gone into business in Tokyo, and later had become a large land-owner there, so that the girl had mingled very little with her own class.” (86)</h6>

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-6">
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">This quote provides an insight and some explanation to why Numè’s father wants to keep her away from other people. His opinions and views on gender roles reflect the societal rules of his class. From our modern standpoint, it is easy to see him as a bad guy in this situation. His daughter has no choice in the matter of who she marries. It is also upsetting because Numè doesn’t believe she gets to decide either. She wants to bring honor to her family by following through with her father’s wishes.</p>

                <h6 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">In this quote, Orito has just told Sachi and Omi that he plans to marry Cleo and not Numè. We see here that Sachi gives insight into how things work in Japanese culture and that duty is extremely important. Since Orito isn’t going through with the marriage to Numè, he is no longer Japanese in his father’s eyes. Shortly after, Sachi and Omi worry about the dishonor brought on their family from this decision and become very reclusive.</h6>

            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-6">
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5">“‘Duty!’ [Orito’s father, Sachi] said, sternly. ‘That is the watchword for a Japanese. Did you forget that in America? Have you ceased to be Japanese?—duty first of all to your parents, to the wife and children to come, and last to yourself’” (106).</p>

                <h6 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">“‘Miss Cleo,’ [the letter] said very simply, ‘I have told my father and Mr. Watanabe that I cannot marry Numè-san because of my supreme love for you. I did not tell them last month, because it was the season of joy, and I wished to save them pain. Now they are very unhappy, but I tell myself that soon will you bring joy to our house’” (109).</h6>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Here we see yet another gender role at play. While Numè was never given the option or the power to choose who she married, Orito can tell his father who he will marry. Even though his father is disappointed and going against your family is looked down upon in Japanese culture, he still has more say in his life than Numè does. She doesn’t know any different and has been indoctrinated to believe she has no choice in the matter.</p>

Jenny offers readers (who are unaware of Japanese traditions) further explanation as to why Orito breaking of the engagement is a big deal within Japanese society. Further, this quote shows that Orito’s actions bring dishonor onto his family as well as Numè’s family because in Japanese culture following the orders of your family is a big deal, and Orito is clearly going against this societal rule.</h6>

For Numè, she has never had an option to make a decision about who she marries. This quote also remarks that she was still “Japanese enough” to follow her father’s wishes. This is interesting to consider because the idea of being “Japanese enough” comes up a lot throughout the book and is often tied to following through with familial wishes.<div><br></div></h6>

This is a glimpse into the gender roles that were at play in Japanese culture during this time. For instance, Omi holds resentment for Numè because she was born a girl rather than a boy. This is also why Omi holds so much excitement for the arranged marriage between Numè and Orito. He later remarks that he only ever saw Numè as Orito’s future wife rather than seeing her as anything else.</p>
